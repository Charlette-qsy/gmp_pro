# General Motor Platform (GMP) library manual summary

GMP is a easy-going library which may help you implement a controller easily.
GMP contains a set of tools for user, you may find then in specified folders.

| Folders | Summary |
| ------- | :------- |
| core/   | This folder provide a set of basic components for the whole library and user. Such as, workflow and it's scheduling, memory management, and abstract of IO devices and etc.. |
| csp/    | This folder contains all the chip support informations. This predefinitions may help you use the library more easily |
| ctl/    | The controller template library. This folder provides not only basic components but also a whole host of controller and it's workflow agent. |
| ext/    | The extension module of the library. This folder contains a lot of devices based on the GMP core. These extensions may help you deploy application easily and rapidly. |
| user/   | The folder is for user to implement their applications. |

## Quick Start

Start a project with GMP library is quite a easy routine. You may follow the four steps.

### compliment your GMP library configure

This file is located in `<user/gmp_user_config.h>`, user may open this file, and change it based on what you need.
Worth mentioning, you should firstly pay attention to the first section of the file.
That is, you should tell the correct `MASTERCHIP`, `MASTER_CHIP_SET` and `COMPILER_TYPE`.

And then change your compiler settings, let your compiler support C++11 standard.

### Add the GMP source to your projects

You should add all the source file (*.c and *.cpp) to compiler candidate.
By the way, you need to add the location of GMP library root PATH to your include path.
All the include command is write using raletive path, based on the GMP library root path.


### Call the `gmp_entry()` function and entry the GMP world

You need to call the `gmp_entry()` function, in your main function, and sometimes you may need to complete a set of preparing firstly, for instance the code generated by CubeMX.
Aiming to let program know the prototype of `gmp_entry()`, firstly,  you should add a include command in your main source file.

If your main source file is a C source file, please add the `core/gmp_core.h` just like the following code.

``` C
#include <core/gmp_core.h>
```

If your main source file is a C++ source file, please add the `core/gmp_core.hpp` just like the following code.

``` C++
#include <cire/gmp_core.hpp>
```

For now, you may invoke the `gmp_entry()` function in your main function. just like the following code does.

``` C++
void main (void)
{
	// Do your preparing code

	// ...

	// Ready to entry the GMP
	gmp_entry(); // invoke the GMP library

	// Some other things.
	// But code NEVER reach here.
}
```

### Final step: just enjoy!

You may start your own work in the `<user/>` folder.
